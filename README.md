# Finus

Digital guitar tuner based on an Arduino Uno board.

## Hardware

The schematic was based on Anthony Kelly's design which can be found [here](http://www.akellyirl.com/arduino-guitar-tuner/). Some values were tweaked to accomodate what I had lying around in my office.

## Software

The basic code for the DSP was based on Amanda Ghassaei's [Arduino Frequency Detection](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Frequency-Detection/). I modified several lines of code to consider the differences in our hardware implementation.
